\usage{
createSpeciesRaster(ranges, rasterTemplate = NULL, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{ranges}{Either a RasterStack, RasterBrick, or species by cell matrix. Any non-NA 
values in rasters are considered presences.}

\item{rasterTemplate}{If input is a species x cell matrix, then a rasterTemplate 
must be provided, where the number of cells = the number of columns in the matrix. 
Cells with a value of 1 will be processed, cells with a value 
of 0 will be . Therefore, all cells must have a value of 0/1.}

\item{verbose}{Primarily intended for debugging, print progress to the console.}
}
\value{
an object of class \code{speciesRaster}.
}
\description{
This function takes a rasterStack and generates both a richness 
raster and an associated list of species per cell, creating an object of 
class \code{speciesRaster}.
}
\details{
This function generates an object of class \code{speciesRaster}, which is a 
list containing the following elements:
\itemize{
	\item{\code{raster:}} {A raster representing counts of species per cell.}
	\item{\code{speciesList:}} {A list of species found in each cell.}
	\item{\code{geogSpecies:}} {a vector of unique species in all cells.}
	\item{\code{cellCount:}} {a vector of counts of presence cells for each species.}
	\item{\code{data:}} {An empty spot that morphological data can be added to.}
	\item{\code{phylo:}} {An empty spot that a phylogeny can be added to.}
}

If input is a RasterStack, then all parameters are taken from that, such as resolution,
extent and projection. Any non-NA and non-zero cell is considered a presence.	
This function expects that all input rasters in the rasterStack have presence values
(i.e., at least 1 non-NA value). If any rasters have exclusively NA cells, then the 
function will stop with a warning, and the output will be the index in the rasterStack
of those rasters.
