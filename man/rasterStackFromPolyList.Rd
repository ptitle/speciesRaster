\usage{
rasterStackFromPolyList(
  polyList,
  resolution = 50000,
  method = "midpoint",
  coverCutoff = 0.1,
  retainSmallRanges = TRUE,
  extent = "auto",
  dropEmptyRasters = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{polyList}{a list of polygons objects (sf or sp), named with taxon names.}

\item{resolution}{vertical and horizontal size of raster cell, in units 
of the polygons' projection.}

\item{method}{approach used for rasterizing. See details below.}

\item{coverCutoff}{the percent that a species range must cover a grid cell to be considered present.}

\item{retainSmallRanges}{boolean; should small ranged species be dropped or preserved.
See details.}

\item{extent}{if 'auto', then the maximal extent of the polygons will be used. 
If not auto, can be a SpatialPolygon or sf object, in which case the resulting rasterStack
will be cropped and masked with respect to the polygon, or a spatial coordinates object, 
from which an extent object will be generated, or a numeric vector of length 4 
with minLong, maxLong, minLat, maxLat. If 'interactive', then an interactive plot
will appear in which the user can draw the desired polygon extent.}

\item{dropEmptyRasters}{if \code{TRUE}, then species that have no presence cells will be dropped.
If \code{FALSE}, then rasters will remain, filled entirely with \code{NA}.}
}
\value{
an object of class \code{RasterStack} where all rasters contain values of 
either NA or 1.
}
\description{
Takes a list of polygons and creates a rasterStack.

\details{
In the rasterization process, two approaches are implemented. For \code{method = 'midpoint'}, 
	a range polygon registers in a cell if the polygon overlaps with the cell midpoint. 
	For \code{method = 'gridcell'}, a range polygon registers in a cell if it covers that cell by 
	at least \code{coverCutoff} fraction of the cell.
	If \code{retainSmallRanges = FALSE}, then species whose ranges are so small that no 
	cell registers as present will be dropped. If \code{retainSmallRanges = TRUE}, then the 
	cells that the small polygon is found in will be considered as present, even if it's a 
	small percent of the cell. \code{retainSmallRanges} only applies to \code{method = 'gridcell'}. 

	If \code{dropEmptyRasters = TRUE} and \code{retainSmallRanges = TRUE}, then the species 
	that will be dropped are those that are outside of the requested extent (which in that
	case would be specified explicitly).  

	In interactive mode for defining the extent, the user can draw a bounding polygon on a 
	map. The drawn polygon will then be printed to the console so that the user can hard-code 
	that bounding polygon in future calls to this function.

	Any SpatialPolygon or SpatialPoints objects are converted to objects of class \code{sf}.

	This function uses the \code{fasterize} package for conversion from polygon to raster.

	In interactive mode, the basemap is from \url{www.naturalearthdata.com}.
